# Rubix Cube Solver

Hi! I’m Akshit Tyagi, and this is a personal project I built — a **Rubix Cube Solver** using computer vision and Python. It detects the colors of each cube face using a webcam or image, computes the optimal solution, and walks through solving it step-by-step.

# Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- NumPy (for matrix handling)
- Kociemba's Algorithm (for solving the cube)

---

# Features
- Detects and captures cube face colors using your webcam or an image
- Computes the **shortest possible solution**
- Step-by-step solver instructions
- User-friendly and easy to extend for hardware integration (e.g., robot arm)

# How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed and required libraries set up:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
